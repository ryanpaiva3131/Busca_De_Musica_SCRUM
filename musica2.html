              I got my peaches out in Georgia (oh, yeah, shit)</br>
              I get my weed from California (that's that shit)</br>
              I took my chick up to the North, yeah (bad-ass bitch)</br>
              I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)</br>
              And I see you (oh)</br>
              The way I breathe you in (in)</br>
              It's the texture of your skin</br>
              I wanna wrap my arms around you, baby</br>
              Never let you go, oh</br>
              And I say, oh</br>
              There's nothing like your touch</br>
              It's the way you lift me up</br>
              Yeah, and I'll be right here with you till the end of time</br>

              You ain't sure yet, but I'm for ya</br>
              All I can want, all I can wish for</br>
              Nights alone that we miss more</br>
              And days we save as souvenirs</br>
              There's no time, I wanna make more time</br>
              And give you my whole life</br>
              I left my girl, I'm in my Yorker</br>
              Hate to leave her, call it torture</br>
              Remember when I couldn't hold her</br>
              Left the baggage for Rimowa</br>

              I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)</br>
              I get the feeling, so I'm sure (sure)</br>
              Hand in my hand because I'm yours (I can't)</br>
              I can't pretend, I can't ignore, you're right for me</br>
              Don't think you wanna know just where I've been, ohh</br>
              Don't be distracted</br>
              The one I need is right in my arms (oh)</br>
              Your kisses taste the sweetest with mine</br>
              And I'll be right here with you till the end of time</br>
